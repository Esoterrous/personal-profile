This is a profile site with overhead I included for the purposes of having
project boilerplate for my other web based projects. It was bootstrapped with
with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone project to your local directory.

Run 'yarn i' and wait for packages to install.

Execute 'yarn dev' to run the project locally, and open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The project is
configured by default to hot-reload so it auto-updates as you edit the files.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.
